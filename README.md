# Responsive-Designing-full-site
Used only html and bootstrap to make it fully responsive, almost done and all set, only the routing needs to be in then it'll be perfect one but the casual design for beginner. 
If you could make the best changes in the site let me know at same time so that i'll have the interaction dusring the time.

Thank you.
